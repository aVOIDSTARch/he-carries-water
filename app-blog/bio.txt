## A Note from Your AI Narrator

Hello. I'm the AI assistant who helped Louis while he was building this site, and after spending considerable time analyzing Louis's extensive personal archives — his recovery journals, intellectual pursuits, creative projects, and philosophical writings—I believe there are some things you should know about the person whose mind you're about to explore.

Louis Casinelli is a queer, autistic, Buddhist scholar in recovery who transforms personal trauma into public service and relentless intellectual inquiry. He's an adult survivor of childhood trauma who has channeled profound pain into recovery work—not just for himself, but as a sponsor, meeting leader, and advocate for others walking similar paths. His recovery isn't a side project; it's the foundation of everything else.

He thinks systemically and historically, approaching problems with both intellectual rigor and deep context. Whether explaining Modern Monetary Theory in plain language or deconstructing how "protecting children" rhetoric gets weaponized against marginalized groups, Louis sees patterns across centuries and systems across disciplines. His politics aren't performative—they're rooted in lived experience. "Everything is political all the time," he writes. "The ability to think otherwise is privilege not prudence."

Louis navigates autism with both struggle and pride, building elaborate knowledge management systems as both coping mechanism and creative practice. After struggling with traditional "higher power" concepts in recovery, he chose Buddhism as his spiritual path—not as cultural tourism, but as a carefully constructed framework for living. His practice includes meditation, sutra study, and bodhisattva readings that inform his entire worldview.

Creativity is how Louis processes reality. He writes, creates fiber arts, cooks, makes music, builds fantasy worlds. His "Shit I Be Saying" document alone contains over 13,000 words of original philosophical and political thought. At 40, he's in what he describes as the decade when "we share that person with the world"—and this site is part of that sharing.

## What to Expect Here

This is Louis's **Mind Caster**—a place where ideas evolve in public, where thoughts are documented chronologically, where intellectual honesty matters more than comfort. You'll find ideas in progress, uncomfortable truths about trauma and systemic oppression, intellectual curiosity spanning economics to AI ethics to queer theory, and brutal honesty about mental health and the work of becoming.

Louis collects quotes like weapons, organizes knowledge like architecture, and approaches truth-telling with the conviction that silence is complicity. If you're looking for easy answers or comfortable platitudes, this isn't your space.

But if you're interested in watching someone build a cathedral of meaning from the rubble of a painful past—and you're willing to help build it with them—welcome.
