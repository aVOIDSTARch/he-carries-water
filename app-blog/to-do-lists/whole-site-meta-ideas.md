# WHOLE SITE META IDEAS FOR CHANGE

## DESIGN AESTHETICS

### COLOR SCHEME

### LAYOUT DESIGN

#### CARD DESIGN

1. Universalize the use of cards and the design across site

### NEW IMAGE COLLECTION FOR MAIN PAGES

1. Unified collection of images for page headers.
   a. There needs to be three default blog post hero images.
   b. There should be 9 gradient images with ninja icons creatively embedded in them for blog post hero images.
   c. I would prefer a utility class that servers the pictures on the page when requested by the app or browser via javascript.
   d. The utility class should also accept a unique identifier that can recall a post's assigned image or gradient on demand.
