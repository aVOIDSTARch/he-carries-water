Being present and aware is the bedrock of enlightenment.\n\n*******\n\nConflict and discord  are only resolved by understanding the people and problems through an angle of loving kindness. We must meditate on the loving understanding of the situation and why the person is the way they are.\n\n*******\n\nOne must learn to stop in order to concentrate. Meditation teaches concentration. Breathing helps us concentrate. \n\nStopping is also resistance and can be a useful form of nonviolent protest\n\n*******\n\nWalking meditation should be done to bring peace and tranquility to practice and those around them\n\n*******\n\nPracticing meditating through breathing and being fully aware throughout our day is key to practicing engaged Buddhism. It is too easy to forget and be swept away with the tides of existence \n\n*******\n\nMake time and space I. Your life for your Buddha nature. Meditation is a constant practice that will bring about peace with time. Anger is fear and fear is the mind killer.\n",
