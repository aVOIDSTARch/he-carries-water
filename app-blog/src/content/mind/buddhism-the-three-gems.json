      "content": "# The Three Gems\n\nPeace is in each of us and it is this peace that can save the world from itself.\n\nEach person who remains calm and smiles sets an example of the possibility of peace for others to follow.\n\n \n\n*******\n\n> I go back and rely on the Buddha in me.\n> \n\nBuddha is understanding and love. It is within us all to be awake. The Buddha is everyone. The Buddhas of reference are past teachers who have soared to great heights that all humans have the ability to attain. As such we should find it easy to love other Buddhas as we love our mentor Buddhas as they would love us.\n\n  \n\n********\n\nSiddhartha practiced meditation 🧘‍♂️ 2500 years ago in the forest with his fellow monks. He learned that making one’s self suffer is not the path to enlightenment. I remember reading in the Dalai Lama’s book that said roughly that “in an attempt to escape suffering many of us often run straight for it.” I think in taking in sustenance and making a comfortable seat for himself Siddhartha achieved enlightenment quicker. Also, it was not alone but through the loving compassion of others that he was able to do so. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n\n *******\n\nThe truths of Buddhism are based on the everyday experiences of real humans not something handed down from gods on high. Our enlightenment is also waiting in our everyday experience not in some lofty place but right here - every day.\n\n*******\n\nBuddha was a person just like the rest of us. He found enlightenment in the everyday lives we lead. This requires no god like powers or preternatural strength. It requires a beginner’s mind and a smile.\n\n*******\n\nBuddhism requires us all. We are all Buddhas by our very nature. There is a a corresponding give-and-take that is present amongst the living creatures of this planet that is required for Buddhism to be real. Be a Buddha. Be compassionate. Be understanding. Be awakened. \n\n*******\n\nThe second gem is the Buddha’s teachings. There are no value adding descriptions of the Dharmakaya. DK can also be just being as an example. The Dharma is in all things as we have been all things. This is not a magical idea but a scientific one. Our atoms have been all things and now they are us for a bit. The dharma is about understanding the true nature of things and showing loving kindness to all beings.\n\n*******\n\nSanghakaya is the body of fellowship that makes the journey along the path beside you. All living beings can be part of our sanghakaya so even when it appears we are alone, we are not. \n\n> I take refuge in the Buddha and the Buddha takes refuge in me. I take refuge in the dharma and the dharma takes refuge in me. I take refuge in the sangha and the sangha takes refuge in me.\n>\n",
