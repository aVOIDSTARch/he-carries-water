Overall idea for this chapter seems to be reminding ourselves that we are not the focus and that we can make ourselves the focus very easily by being attached to worldly pleasures.\n2. Heavy socialist themes ❤️\n3. The parts about the person being jealous of the bodhisattva is a warning to not think so highly of myself and to remember how easily being a good person can provoke them to harm themselves - be careful as this is harm to all.\n",
