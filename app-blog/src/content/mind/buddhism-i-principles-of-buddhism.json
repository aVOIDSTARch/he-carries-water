      "content": "# I. Principles of Buddhism\n\n1. The Truth of Suffering\n    1. There is suffering\n2. The Truth of its Source \n    1. It has a cause\n3. The Truth of its Cessation\n    1. Suffering can be ended\n4. The Truth of the Path to Enlightenment \n    1. There is a path to the end of suffering\n- Three Levels of Understanding\n    - Through study\n        - Intellectual\n    - Through deep contemplation\n        - Emotional\n    - Though mediative practice\n        - Practical\n- Two general realms of causation\n    - Internal\n        - Mental\n    - External\n        - Physical\n    - Both realms are transient\n    - Subject to moment-to-moment change\n- Dependent Origination\n    - Everything arises and ceases in dependence on causes and conditions\n    - Both mental and physical conditions can only arise or be directly influenced by like sources\n    - The Buddhist believes that this truth logically leads to the fact that consciousness must have an original source at the beginning of the universe in the same way that the physical material of the universe does - panpsychism/quantum consciousness\n    - Three Key Conditions\n        - Absence of a designer condition\n            - No creator god\n        - Condition of impermanence\n            - Change is the only sure thing\n            - Parable of the Sower - “God is change”\n        - Condition of potentiality\n            - Like arises from like as above\n- Four Principles of Reality\n    - The universe is deterministic\n    - Suffering arises from our mental existence thus understanding our minds can help with suffering\n    1. Principle of Nature\n        1. We possess a natural desire to be happy and overcome suffering\n        2. Like the natural law in science, it also implies that everything follows from causes and conditions \n        3. It also presupposes an evolution in the universe\n        4. Karma means action\n            1. As in cause and effect where a sentient being provides the intentional act\n    2. Principle of Dependence \n        1. Following from the idea that “things exist,” this principle says that further things exist because the original things caused them to\n    3. Principle of Function\n        1. Every existing thing has innate characteristics simply because they exist\n        2. John Locke said this in “Essay concerning human understanding”\n        3. \n            \n            [Primary-secondary quality distinction - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary%E2%80%93secondary_quality_distinction)\n            \n    4. Principle of Valid Reasoning\n        1. Aristotelian Syllogism \n        2. Given this then that\n        3. The term valid makes me think of Descartes’ struggle to find a first point of truth from which to build a logical basis for all truths - cogito ergo sum\n    5. All the principles are an attempt for Buddhists to have a basis for an ontological exploration\n- The Four Noble Truths\n    - Three kinds of Suffering\n        1. Suffering of Suffering\n            1. This is the natural suffering of existence that even animals experience\n        2. Suffering of Change\n            1. Even non-Buddhists can recognize and mitigate this kind of suffering \n        3. Pervasive Suffering of Conditional Existence \n            1. The specific suffering of sentience and the troubles of being a mind \n            2. Caused by:\n                1. Karma arises from mental afflictions either conceptual or emotional \n                2. Afflictions are deep disturbances or unrest which in turn give rise to more afflictions \n            3. Three Basic Poisons of the Mind\n                1. Attachment\n                2. Anger\n                3. Delusion - our mistaken notion of grasping at the real existence of things or events and is the catalyst for the other two poisons\n            4. In Fundamentals of the Middle Way, Nagarjuna -the Second Buddha - explains that only through contemplation of the emptiness of self and phenomena can we break the cycle of samsara\n            5. Understanding emptiness and exercising compassion are Buddhism, kurtzgesagt\n            6. “the beautiful activity of one who has realized emptiness and engages in compassionate behavior” 🥰\n\nThe Three Higher Trainings \n\n1. Morality\n    1. Foundation for single-pointedness of mind\n    2. Ordained vs layperson precepts\n    3. Practice of ethical discipline \n2. Concentration \n    1. Single-pointedness of mindl\n3. Wisdom\n    1. 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment \n    2. Bodhichitta \n    3. Ontological exploration \n    4. The afflictions of the mi d are separate from its nature \n    5. Activate and perfect the potential for full awakening\n",
