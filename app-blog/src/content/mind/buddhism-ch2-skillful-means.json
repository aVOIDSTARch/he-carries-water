They appear in this world to cause sentient beings to attain the wisdom and insight of a buddha’s enlightenment. They appear in this world in order to cause sentient beings to enter the path of the wisdom and insight of a buddha.\n> \n\nAll beings are capable of reaching parinirvana and will eventually because having heard the dharma it is inevitable.
