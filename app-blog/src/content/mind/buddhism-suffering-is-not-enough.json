It colors our every perception and affects the world around us.\n\nWe avoid conscious contact with ourselves.\n\nMeditation is being aware of all aspects of the now. \n\n> … to meditate well, we must smile a lot.\n> \n\nWe can bring peace and happiness to others by bringing it inside ourselves and allowing it to be reflected outward through our genuine smile and peaceful actions.\n\nWe can begin to bring peace into ourselves through meditation 🧘‍♂️ \n\n*******\n\nPractices giving yourself time to relax and smile when you do.\n\n> A smile makes you master of yourself.\n> \n- We futurecast our lives too much.\n- Calming,Smiling, Present moment,  Wonderful moment“\n\n*******\n\nWe are like empty vessels that are filled with the things we put our focus on or put energy into. When we allow things other than ourselves to fill our vessel we can be harmed or propagate harm to others by filling their vessels with the toxic brew we are carrying. Meditation empties our vessel and affords us the opportunity to fill it with ourselves and patience and compassion and love. Smiling during meditation is a sign that we are filling our own vessels with ourselves. Smiling at others is a way to know we are filling others’ vessels with the best parts of us.\n\n*******\n\n> It is with our capacity of smiling, breathing, and being peace that we can make peace.\n> \n\nThe Buddha nature is a woke nature. The seed of that wokeness is the child-mind - the beginner’s mind. We all harbor the child of Buddha in us and with it the potential to awaken to our true nature as Buddhas. Nurture your inner child with smiles, breathing, and being peace for they know what you feel and nourish your mind and body with and they consume as you do. Our spiritual health and progress is contingent on how we choose to exist in this world and with what we fill our vessels.\n",
