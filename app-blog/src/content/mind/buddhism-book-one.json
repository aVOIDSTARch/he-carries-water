      "content": "# Book One\n\n\n# Chapter One\n\nSvasti has left his home in the countryside to be at the Forest Monastery near the city and has taken vows to follow the Ten Precepts. He has learned that begging for food teaches humility and is a part of the lessons that teach the path of the Dharma. \n\n# Chapter Two\n\n## Tending Water Buffaloes\n\nThe Buddha teaches the dharma lesson using the life experiences of normal people as allegory for the path. He finds ways that the bhikkhus can identify with the practices in their everyday lives as to make learning easier to absorb and remember.\n\nRahula uses Ananda’s memory as a resource as do all of the bhikkhus. This shows how each member of the sangha contributes to the greater strength of the community. Each person has something unique and important to offer.\n\nRahula shows compassion by telling Svasti that it is natural to miss your family and your old way of life. He shares his experience with the same pain and offers to recount positive stories of his experience as a way of alleviating his friends suffering.\n\n# Chapter Three\n\n## An Armful of Kusa Grass\n\nEven the least fortunate among us have the same value as all others. No one is lower than anyone else. No one is untouchable. It was the lowest of the low that helped the Buddha to reach enlightenment by making his sitting more comfortable with his simple offering of grass. And in that moment he found value and love in himself for having helped a stranger who treated him with respect and kindness in return.\n\n# Chapter Four\n\n## The Wounded Swan\n\nThe Buddha teaches his differently born students that caste is irrelevant and all people are equal.\n\nThe Buddha’s cousin shot a swan with bow and arrow and the Buddha found the wounded animal and took to caring for it. The cousin demanded he return it so they went to the royal council and even throu Siddhartha felt he was correct his father forced the decision in his favor so it felt hollow. \n\nWe should always err on the side of loving compassion even when the majority is not in accord with our viewpoint.\n\n# Chapter Five\n\n## A Bowl of Milk\n\nSujata met the Buddha when we was about to die and nursed him back to life with a bowl of milk and he realized that abusing your body for religious enlightenment was the wrong path. She also introduced him to the villagers and her family.\n\n# Chapter 6\n\n## Beneath a Rose-Apple Tree\n\nSiddhartha is born and a prophecy is given that he will either become a great king or a great spiritual leader. His goatherd takes him to the first plowing ceremony where he gets his first experience with death, suffering,  and poverty and is spurred to meditate beneath a rose-apple tree much to his father’s chagrin. \n\n# Chapter 7\n\n## White Elephant Prize\n\nThe King and Queen introduce Siddhartha to the neighboring princess in an attempt got distract him from his religious investigations and conversations with monks and hermits about the wrongdoings of the Brahmins and the caste system in general.\n\n# Chapter 8\n\n## The Jeweled Necklace\n\nThe Buddha gave his love internet his own necklace. This I believe shows that he is compassionate and generous.\n\n# Chapter 9\n\n## The Path of Compassion\n\nSiddhartha and Yasodhara were never content to be high ranking courtiers but desired to show compassion to the “least of these.” Gotami - the Buddha’s mother - was not content to just hold a “woman’s place” in society either. So the three of them sought pleasure in being true to themselves through acts of liberty and compassion within the constraints of their caste society.\n\n# Chapter 10\n\n## Unborn Child\n\nWhile the Buddha and his wife struggle with the inner turmoil of trying to be woke in a sleeping society and at the height of their own power in said society, it is discovered that Yasodhara - Gopa - is with child. \n\n*I think Gopa is an old Hindi word for a Stan but like in reference to religion \n\n# Chapter 11\n\n## Moonlight Flute\n",
