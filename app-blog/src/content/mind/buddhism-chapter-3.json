There is great joy in being the lighthouse.\n2. I envision this as a chain of torches starting with the Buddhas and then bodhisattvas and linked through Bodhichitta in an unending stream of light and consciousness\n3. I will strive to give all I am and have and will succumb to making the lives of others better and by this sacrifice I hope that others with achieve enlightenment and joy.\n4. It is not worth having anything if it means that others go without.\n5. This will inevitably lead to great sacrifices and letting go of things in this world. There is no other way.\n6. “a rising moon of mind”\n7. I must excel and succeed in the things I do so I can use them to be the lighthouse for my tiny one-seven point something billionth of this world.\n8. This is a position of servitude and hospitality 🥰\n",
