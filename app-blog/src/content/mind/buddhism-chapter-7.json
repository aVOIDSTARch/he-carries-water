Effort must be put into the practice of dharma in order to stay on a path and grow my flame.\n2. Aspiration, to me, is the desire to be bodhisattva derived from an intentional contemplation of the path I am on. Always looking ahead at the brighter lights who have come before.\n3. Self-confidence is the strength that is born of that aspiration that reminds me that I standing in power that has been discovered and refined for our kind throughout time immemorial and is guaranteed to free us all. This is my turn to grow the light of the path. This must be tempered with the knowledge that this is a privilege of service and not a place to worship myself. \n4. Power of Joy seems self explanatory but I think that from the aspiration (seed) grew the self-confidence. With much water (contemplation and practice) this flower has blossomed in the light of the path. This bloom is the beauty of joy. Boundless happiness for the path and all the humans on it. \n5.\n",
