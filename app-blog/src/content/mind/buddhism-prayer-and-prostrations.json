      "content": "# Prayer and Prostrations\n\n- General Confession\n\nWoe is me!\n\nO [spiritual mentors](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/lama/), great vajra holders, and all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas who abide in the ten directions, as well as all the venerable [Sangha](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/sangha/), please pay attention to me.\n\nI, who am named _________ , circling in cyclic existence since beginningless time until the present, overpowered by afflictions such as [attachment](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/attachment/), hostility and ignorance, have created the ten destructive actions by means of [body](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/body/), speech and mind. I have engaged in the five heinous actions and the five parallel heinous actions.[4](https://thubtenchodron.org/2011/06/visualization-thirty-five-buddhas/#fn4-22482) I have transgressed the [precepts](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/precept/) of individual liberation,[5](https://thubtenchodron.org/2011/06/visualization-thirty-five-buddhas/#fn5-22482) contradicted the trainings of a [bodhisattva](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/bodhisattva/),[6](https://thubtenchodron.org/2011/06/visualization-thirty-five-buddhas/#fn6-22482)broken the tantric commitments.[7](https://thubtenchodron.org/2011/06/visualization-thirty-five-buddhas/#fn7-22482) I have been disrespectful to my kind parents, [spiritual mentors](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/lama/), spiritual friends, and those following the pure paths. I have committed actions harmful to the [Three Jewels](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/three-jewels/), avoided the holy Dharma, criticized the arya [Sangha](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/sangha/), and harmed living beings. These and many other destructive actions I have done, have caused others to do, and have rejoiced in others’ doing. In short, I have created many obstacles to my own higher rebirth and liberation, and have planted countless seeds for further wanderings in cyclic existence and miserable states of being.\n\nNow in the presence of the [spiritual mentors](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/lama/), the great vajra holders, all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas who abide in the ten directions, and the venerable [Sangha](https://thubtenchodron.org/glossary/sangha/), I confess all of these destructive actions, I will not conceal them and I accept them as destructive. I promise to refrain from doing these actions again in the future. By confessing and acknowledging them, I will attain and abide in happiness, while by not confessing and acknowledging them, true happiness will not come.\n\n- Our secrets keep us sick. This prayer will help remind me that I fuck up and have fuck up and that there are others who have learned to mitigate this behavior better than I have ❤️\n- Using joy\n\n\n- Use a focused mind for the benefit of all others\n",
