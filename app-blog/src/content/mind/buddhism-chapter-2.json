There is a strong focus on humility through mediative offerings of things one values to teachers who love and care for others - nowhere does it say these teachers have to be explicitly on a path of Buddhism to the outward world. Learn from all the good and altruistic sources you can.\n2. Jesusism - remember your own flawed state while learning. Stay humble. Seek humility like water in a desert.\n3. The Buddhas and bodhisattvas have perfected this lifestyle. Learn from them always.\n4. Everyone of us has committed great harms against our fellow humans and must recall and address these crimes before we can forgive ourselves and learn from the mistakes. Making amends.\n5. The dharma shows us the way to live free of our own flaws. Remember that for some the steps are their incarnation of dharma. Meet people where they are. Love them as they are.\n6. Do not seek guidance only when things are going terribly; humbly seek wisdom at all times. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. No foxhole prayers.\n7. Accept that this path may go on further than this body does but I still must strive for the goal of enlightenment.\n",
