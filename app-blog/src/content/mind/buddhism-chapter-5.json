This is paramount\n\n\n\n\n• Vigilance leads to protected mindfulness leads to undistracted mind leads to future enlightenment verse 33\n\n\n\n- Using the steps in everything you do ^\n- “My body and my mind must remain correctly composed” taking a regular inventory to maintain my peace and direction39-41, 108\n\n\n- Recovery sounds a lot like diet version of dharma - in the end, they are both attempting to point a way to peace and love\n- In times of intense danger to our mind we must endeavor to take extra steps to prepare v42,43\n\n\n- Buddha says the environment must be protect as much as our mind for in damaging it we damage ourselves and others ❤️\n- Impassive as wood instead of succumbing to distraction in any form\n\n\n- Direct compassion equally towards those who seek to harm me for they are in delusion as much as I am\n\n\n- We can achieve enlightenment only through helping others with authentic kindness and compassion. All beings offer this opportunity to us especially those who seek to harm us\n- Practice the Sutra of the Three Heaps 3x in the morning and at night- link in Notion\n- Mahayana Sutras\n1. Akashagarbha sutra\n2. Compendium of Trainings\n3. Condensed Compendium of Sutras\n\n\nNOTES ON CHAPTER:\n\n1. Vigilance is the foundation of bodhisattva practice. We learn to be mindful, virtuous, kind, and show compassion easily. And we can relearn it over and over but if we lose our peace of mind we cannot become stronger in it than that first lesson provides\n2. An uncontrolled mind, especially one with the wisdom provided on the path is as dangerous as an elephant drunk and rampaging in a sleeping village. Restraint through training is an act of love for all beings including the bodhisattva\n3. All harms from humans are created by minds exactly like mine. If I can learn to control my own and I also learn to protect it from external and distractions as well\n4. Once we understand and apply vigilance, control of the mind may begin. We use mindfulness through meditation and alertness practices that have been passed down through the path of wisdom.\n5. Distraction is the greatest enemy of the path. This comes in the form of others who are lost, our own internal dieties, and the worldly desires not grounded in the wisdom of the Buddhas. I - at least for now - think this means not necessarily becoming a monk as much as making sure all I do has this path at its core. That all things I strive for must lead to compassion and kindness for others or I do not need to do them. My education and occupational choices need to be guided with the intent to make the world better with equanimity for all beings.\n6. Remember that the Maitreya appeared to Asanga in the forms that would help him most and none were monks or religious figures. If a bodhisattva is being compassionate in all things, the lighthouse is ablaze in any outward appearance.\n7. And again for good measure, knowledge without action is not wisdom.\n",
