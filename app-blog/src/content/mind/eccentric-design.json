      "content": "# Initial Conception\n\nThe idea that design can be both minimal and expressive isn't contradictory. Brutalism teaches us that constraints breed creativity. Hard edges, bold shadows, monospace fonts - these aren't limitations, they're a language.\n\nWhat if we embraced the 'eccentric' not as chaos, but as intentional deviation from the expected?",

      "content": "# The Role of Shadows\n\nHard shadows (4px offset, no blur) create a sense of **depth without softness**. They're honest about their artificiality. Unlike gradient shadows that try to mimic reality, hard shadows say: \"I am a digital artifact, and that's okay.\"\n\nThis honesty is what makes brutalist design feel more authentic than skeuomorphism ever did.",

      "content": "# Typography as Voice\n\nSwitching from Atkinson to DM Sans wasn't just about aesthetics - it was about finding a voice that's both **demonstrative** and **professional**. \n\nDM Sans has personality in its letterforms (especially 'a', 'g', 'y') without screaming for attention. It's confident, not loud.\n\nPaired with Space Mono for code/headings, we get a technical-humanist balance.",
