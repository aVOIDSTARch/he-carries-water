      "content": "# III. Atisha’s Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment\n\nAtisha was commissioned to write a concise and accessible version of the dharma so that all may understand it\n\n\nThis verse is a set of salutations to the Three Gems and an acknowledgment of request for a teacher to arrive because the students require it. In Buddhism, teaching is made upon request. \n\n> When the teacher is ready, the student will arrive.\n> \n\n# Understanding the Three Jewels\n\n1. The buddha\n    1. “You who have become a valid being”\n    2. Cultivation of great compassion \n    3. Cultivation of the wisdom of emptiness \n2. The dharma \n    1. Ultimate fruit of dharma is to learn to prevent our afflictions from arising again\n    2. Our actions themselves are not our primary cause of suffering; rather, suffering arises from intention or thoughts and emotions \n    3. Afflictive states of mind underlie our negative karma and thus our suffering\n    4. Relief from suffering is brought about by the practicing and cultivation of positive emotions and intense compassion in the stead of hatred and anger\n    5. The escape from suffering lies at the heart of dependent origination\n    6. First: We can say that our distorted understanding of the world is at the root of our afflictive emotions such as anger, hatred, and attachment.\n    7. Second: our perception of the world as independent reality has no valid grounding\n    8. Third: when we cultivate the direct antidote, which is the wisdom of no-self, the directly counters our misconception of the world as having a true and independent existence.\n    9. We will truly believe buddhahood is positively inve we come to accept that not only is suffering removable but also the causes and damages of said suffering as well\n\nFour Embodiments of Full Enlightenment \n\n1. svabbavakaya \n    1. The natural embodiment of the Buddha\n2. Dharmakaya \n    1. omniscient of the Buddha \n3. Sambhogakaya \n    1. Buddha of perfect resource\n    2. The subtle energy or prana \n4. Nirmanakaya\n    1. When this subtle energy or prana takes a visible form\n\n## Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels\n\nDignaga states that a buddha is someone who has attained full enlightenment through the cultivation of compassion and wisdom of no-self - the absence of self-existence\n\nThe Dharma Gesel is the path by which we can gradually accomplish buddhahood \n\nThe sangha is the community of practitioners who directly realized emptiness\n\n# Levels of Spiritual Trainees\n\n\nBodhichitta must be cultivated first the light the intimate desire to alleviate the suffering of others by atraining buddhahood.\n\nNext one must attains a deep understanding of our own suffering in order to comprehend the suffering of others.\n\nThis would awaken the Bodhichitta in one of three capacities: small, middling, supreme.\n\nSmall capacity practices are just behaving in a moral manner and not harming others or yourself. \n\nThe middling way works to dismantle our idea of “self.” Allowing oneself to escape the cycle of samsara\n\nThe final capacity is manifest in attempting to release all people from the pain of rebirth and death eternally.\n\n# Three Principle Factors of the Path\n\nNagarjuna identified three factors for the attainment of enlightenment \n\n1. Bodhichitta\n    1. Desire to reach enlightenment for the betterment of all\n2. Powerful force of compassion \n    1. Intent AND action to relieve suffering of others\n3. Non-dual wisdom\n    1. Neither absolutism or nihilism. The middle path \n\nOne must not be discouraged by the path \n\nThe Hindu and Buddhist traditions presented a body-mind ontological theory nearly identical to the “cogito ergo sum” over two millennia prior to Descartes. They noted that since something is here to perceive things, then, that something at the very least must exist regardless of the validity of the perceptions.\n\n# The Question of Rebirth\n\nBuddhism abides by the scientific method. If something is disproven, it is placed aside and not believed. We do not cling to falsehood.\n\nCritical thinking is used when interpreting scripture and ancient texts.\n\nSome things may yet be unknowable due in part to our limited minds.\n\nThree classes of phenomena:\n\n1. The evident \n    1. Observable directly \n2. The slightly obscured\n    1. Inferred through reason\n3. Extremely obscured\n    1. Beyond our present ability to recognize\n    2. Through testimony of someone who has experienced it\n    3. You only know your birthday because your parents tell you it is so\n\n### The Four Reliances\n\n\nOn the basis of this reliance principle, we subject all authority or evidence to scrutiny, including the Buddha.\n\nMotives must be scrutinized as well.\n\n# The Level of Initial Capacity\n\n## Cultivating Bodhichitta\n\nVows of the Bodhisattva \n\n\n\n\nThree ethical disciplines of the bodhisattva\n\n1. Refraining from negative actions\n2. Engaging in positive actions \n3. Working for others’ welfare\n",
