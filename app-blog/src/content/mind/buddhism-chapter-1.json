      "content": "# Chapter 1\n\n# An explanation of the benefits of Bodhichitta\n\n\n- verses 1-3 - sharing is caring\n- bodhichitta is a “compassionate mind wishing for enlightenment “\n- if I want to help others Bodhichitta is the most effective path\n- Bodhichitta has a duality within comprised of thought AND action\n- thought is powerful and influential but only action brings freedom and change\n- this path is solely for the benefit of all beings - to bring them enlightenment and peace. it is this which bring the walker the same\n- verse 28\n\n\n• practice as a meditative prayer\n\n\n• While existence lies in darkness and suffering, occasionally- through this practice - the good intentions of a bodhisattva may flash like a lighthouse in a storm.\n\n\nNOTES ON CHAPTER:\n\n1. I have to strive to understand and practice making my improvements for the sole benefit of others in order to grow and help myself. This is the ONLY way.\n2. Even the smallest kindnesses are important. Learning to do this for others will show me how to do the same for myself.\n3. This path is built on compassion and intention made tangible with kindness in action. I must be vigilant that my intellectual nature does not trap me with inaction preventing my progress.\n4. Be cautious that in attempting to help, I do not harm. Hippocratic oath.\n5. Verse 2 - We only keep what we have by giving it away. The truth is revealed by passing it along. Teaching provides clarity that otherwise is unattainable - remember to be humble about my station along this path as to not lead others astray.\n6. I am not the shore. Maybe one day I can be a lighthouse though. A brief flash of guidance - love and kindness - to a struggling ship.\n7. Remember this above all else: there is no escape from samsara alone. We all must attain enlightenment or it cannot precipitate from our collective consciousness. This path is for everyone and everyone is on this path.\n8. Every kindness to others is a kindness to myself.\n9. Just walk the path for a while learning and practicing kindness and compassion. There is no need to talk of this decision to others yet or maybe ever….(?)\n10. Practice: strive to find a way to love all as I love Jewel. This is going to be hard. Try. Keep trying. Try again.\n",
