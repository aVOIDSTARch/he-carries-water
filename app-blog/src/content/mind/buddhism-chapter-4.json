      "content": "# Chapter 4\n\n# Relying on Conscientiousness\n\n\n\n\n• primary purpose ^\n\nNOTES ON CHAPTER:\n\n1. This is not an on again off again commitment. Once here I must strive to always be on the path without delay.\n2. I cannot honestly expect too be a lighthouse who carries no light. It is irresponsible to lead others while failing to lead myself.\n3. For me too disrupt another bohdisattva is a terrible crime against all the world. It is to break the chain of Bodhichitta that lights the long path.\n4. This is a one way out scenario. All deviations from the path lead to samsara and delusion.\n5. I must take this precious opportunity to dedicate my being to following Buddha on the path as it may never arise again - this is where I have always been going and have fought tooth and nail to avoid to the destruction of my life.\n6. Even existing as a human means that I earned a place on this path through hard work in past lives (different incarnations or selves I believe in this lifetime.) We have chances to reincarnate ourselves every day. If, having reached “a rare human” form, we choose to turn away from the Buddha-lit path, it may be very difficult to recognize this condition in ourselves in the future.\n- Noting how difficult it can be to recognize this trait in ourselves, it should be with great humility that we judge others whom we do not know like we do ourselves…. They may be the very light we are seeking - this will take a lot of work for me. 🤌\n1. Verse 20: “…it is extremely difficult to obtain a precious human life;” The poet reminds us that the Buddha advises vigilance over that life for the world’s sake. Every bodhisattva is a chance for others to see the glow of the path in the distance and wander toward a chance at humanity ❤️\n2. It is only through acceptance of the delusion that I create for myself that I fall from the path. No one can carry me away to hells of my own creation but me. My anger, jealousy, sadness, and attachments are but a few of the demons I create to carry me away. They pay no rent in my world. They are not real. They have no power that I do not give them freely.\n3. This is my second opportunity as human. I have spent a lifetime wandering aimlessly in my own hell. If one chance is exceedingly rare, this second one is infinitesimally small. Don’t fuck it up\n\n\n1. 1. We do this to ourselves.\n\n\n1. The enemy that is my own delusion cannot be addressed as I would the enemy in the life of perception. This is folly. Do not think to use the tools of this life in that battle.\n- Reservations 👇\n\n\n1. Always Vigilant verse 36\n\n\n1.  Ego death. verse 38\n\n\n1. Those who suffer bravely for the “great purpose” are warriors of light. ❤️ but must also remember note 13above.\n2. It is a vile deception to both self and the world to attempt to show the path to others when I don’t know where it is.\n\n\nJesusism: judge not lest ye be judged; worry about the log in your own eye before the speck in another’s; he without sin cast the first stone\n\n1. Primary purpose: fight my own demons; have a care for my side of the street; turn on the streetlights for the safe egress of others\n\n\n1. Defeat your reservations to prevent delusions from having safe harbor in distant lands\n\n\n\n1. Our reservations are delusions. They are trucks of our minds sleights of hand we use to convince ourselves to allow harm in our world in case it overwhelms and we choose to leave the path\n2. My use of spite as a shield against relapse was my pride hiding reservations from me. Thus I cannot follow a path to enlightenment paved with my character defects no matter how effective they may appear at the time\n",
